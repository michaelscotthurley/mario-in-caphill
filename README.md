Super Mario Bros: Lost in Capitol Hill

My game uses a gameboard and theme designed in HTML and styled with CSS. I used jQuery to program the game logic. My approach was to get a working UI prior to writing the game logic. I think I focused too heaviliy on the UI at first, leaving too little time for the jQuery necessary to play the game. Writing the game was challenging, especially implementing two player-mode. One piece of functionality I wanted to implement was to have each item match "stored" in each player's scoreboard, but I was unable to achieve this. Also my game is not responsive as it uses many absolute and static HTML elements.
